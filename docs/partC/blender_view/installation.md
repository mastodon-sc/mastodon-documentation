## Installation

* Install [Fiji](https://imagej.net/downloads) and [Blender](https://blender.org/download) on your computer.
    * Make sure to install Blender as a "portable" installation. The reason for this is that the Mastodon Blender
      Plugin needs write access to the Blender installation directory, which may not be possible with a standard
      installation.
* Activate the "Mastodon-Tomancak" [update site](https://imagej.net/update-sites/following) in Fiji.
    * ![Mastodon.png](installation/Mastodon.png)
* Open Fiji and create / open a Mastodon project.
* In Mastodon's main menu, you will find an entry ```Window > Blender Views > Setup Blender Addon ...```, click it and
  follow the
  instructions to install the Mastodon Blender Plugin.
